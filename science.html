	<div class="body"> 
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"> The name NoetherTech is an acknowledgement
		and homage to one of the greatest mathematicians in history, Amalie Emmy Noether. She has 
		been praised as the most important woman in the history of mathematics by Albert Einstein, 
		Jean Dieudonné, and Norbert Wiener, to name a few. After she began her work as a professor, 
		Noether made a multitude of contributions over her 27 years of professional work across many 
		mathematical fields. She was especially remembered for her work on abstract algebra, a highly 
		innovative field of 20th-century mathematics, that is still deeply studied to this day. </p> 
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> In 1915, Noether was recruited to help solve an issue with 
		Einstein's theory of general relativity. The resulting solution was named Noether's theorem, 
		which states that conserved quantities can be found in symmetries in the laws of nature. 
		Although this theory has become one of the fundamental tools in modern theoretical physics, 
		it has also reshaped the way we approach many problems in the physical world. In particular, 
		the inspiration behind much of the technology at NoetherTech can be traced back to, and 
		credited to this particular piece of revolutionary work by Emmy Noether. </p>

			<h3> Laws of Thermodynamics </h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Total energy of any isolated system is constant </li>
				<li> The entropy of any isolated system always increases </li>
				<li> Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the 
				temperature approaches absolute zero</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"> NoetherTech's technology was developed based on 
		the fundamental principles of physics in laws of symmetry and conservation, thermodynamics, 
		information theory, and understanding of neural default states and their roles in neural physiology. 
		Our EMBP treatment model is developed based on the theory that the brain can be modeled as an open 
		thermodynamic system with dissipative structure. The priciple that guides the coordinated neuronal 
		connection and behavior is the minimal entropy law described in dissipative thermodynamic theory. 
		The massive synaptic connections effectively reduce the translational and rotational degrees of 
		freedom of all neurons (vibrational degrees of freedom are negligible at body temperature), and the 
		coherent neuronal firing resembles formation of translational symmetry. The former strategy decreases 
		the total level of kinetic energy, and the latter reduces energy consumption through conservation to 
		increase the stability in the brain as a whole system. </p> 
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> The brain, and many other biological systems, is an open thermodynamic 
		system that takes matter and free energy from the environment to form order within the system and 
		dissipate entropy outward to the environment. It is constrained by a fixed inflow of free energy in 
		the form of chemical nourishment and information from the environment. The internal spontaneous process 
		may be described as a steady state of entropy production. </p>
		
		
		<div id="quote1" class="textbox">
			<h3> Biological systems, including the brain, must follow the first principles of physics </h3>
		</div>
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> A neural system, for example, will not violate the law to spontaneously 
		increase its energy metabolism to risk its stability. Quite the opposite, the default state of the brain 
		has been recently found to be in the lowest energy state with rhythmic electric oscillation. In certain 
		pathological conditions, such as stroke and concussion, the brain would turn itself into even lower 
		frequency activity to conserve energy regardless as to how much cognitive or sensory motor functions 
		would be affected. In other words, our culturally defined brain functions are not necessarily in the 
		best interest of the brain. Our biological brain function is primarily concerned with survival. </p>
		
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> According to this model, cognitive functions can be described as 
		epiphenomena of the brain’s strategies to maintain stability. Structure damage or change in symmetric 
		neuronal firing alters the states of energy; levels of deviation from the norm may result in various 
		changes in behaviors or other symptoms. In this limited sense, there are much fewer brain energy 
		states tan phenomenological measures of symptoms. EMBP is designed to evaluated and normalize 
		deviation of the brain state to help improve the slinical symptoms. The treatment protocol consists of 
		two components: an electroencephalography (EEG_ recording to evaluate the brain state, and an 
		individualized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment guided by the EEG to normalize that 
		state. </p>
		
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> Furthermore, the brain's oscillatory default state reveals obedience of 
		another physical law - conservation in symmetry. Energy must be conserved in an oscillation invariant 
		over time. The more symmetrical the EEG oscillation (greater frequency selectivity) is, the lower the 
		brain metabolic rate it has. In addition, the frequency selectivity of EEG (low energy measure) has 
		been found to be predictive for subject's cognitive performance. We thus speculate that culturally 
		accepted cognitive functions are likely to be epiphenomena of the brain's survival strategy. Dealing 
		with mental conditions must consider the brain's default "interests." </p>
