		<p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"> The name NoetherTech is an acknowledgement
		and homage to one of the greatest mathematicians in history, Amalie Emmy Noether. She has 
		been praised as the most important woman in the history of mathematics by Albert Einstein, 
		Jean Dieudonné, and Norbert Wiener, to name a few. After she began her work as a professor, 
		Noether made a multitude of contributions over her 27 years of professional work across many 
		mathematical fields. She was especially remembered for her work on abstract algebra, a highly 
		innovative field of 20th-century mathematics, that is still deeply studied to this day. </p> 
		
		<p style="margin-top: 11px;"> In 1915, Noether was recruited to help solve an issue with 
		Einstein's theory of general relativity. The resulting solution was named Noether's theorem, 
		which states that conserved quantities can be found in symmetries in the laws of nature. 
		Although this theory has become one of the fundamental tools in modern theoretical physics, 
		it has also reshaped the way we approach many problems in the physical world. In particular, 
		the inspiration behind much of the technology at NoetherTech can be traced back to, and 
		credited to this particular piece of revolutionary work by Emmy Noether. </p>
